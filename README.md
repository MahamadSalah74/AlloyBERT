# AlloyBERT

This github repo was developed during a summer internship at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory through the Pathways to Computing Internship Program. The work is an extension on this [repo](https://github.com/peizong/alloy2vec) worked on by my mentor Dr. Junqi Yin! In this project a large transformers language model is trained on a dataset of material science publications and the results are compared to the previously mentioned repo that used mat2vec to train on the same data.
