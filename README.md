# AlloyBERT

This repository was developed during a summer internship at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory through the Pathways to Computing Internship Program. This work is an extension on this [repository](https://github.com/peizong/alloy2vec) worked on by my mentor Dr. Junqi Yin! 

AlloyBERT is a large transformers lanaguge model trained on a dataset of more than 6 million material science publications using the Summit Supercomputer. We used the BERT embeddings to investigate how well the model can differentiate between alloys based on their crystal structures.

Shown below is a umap plot of BERT embeddings for a subset of FCC and BCC alloys
